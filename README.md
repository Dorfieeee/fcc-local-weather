### Rules

- All pull requests must be reviewed and approved before they can be merged
- All commits must be made from a unique branch name! (ex. do not name your branch with your name/do not reuse a branch unless you are committing another change to the same branch, use names such as fixed-documentation-typo, etc)

### Contribution a change

Once you finish making your changes, you are ready to push your change!

#### Github Desktop

Once you make your Pull Request, you are done!

#### Git CLI

> This assumes you have already cloned the repo and are on the default main branch, to change back to the main branch `git checkout main`

- Pull all the latest changes `git pull`
- Checkout a new branch `git checkout -b descriptive-branch-name`
- Make your changes
- Add all of your changes files to the commit `git add .` from the root of the project dir
- Check that all of the files you want committed are in git status
- Make your commit `git commit`
  - Make sure your commit message is descriptive
  - The first line is the title of the commit
  - Following lines are the description of the commit
- Push your commit `git push -u origin your-branch-name`

### Change Guidelines

> The guidelines must be followed and may result in your change being denied

- Your title or description of your commit MUST include the words: closes, fixes, resolves followed by the issue # (ex. fixes #5, or resolves #7)
- The title of your commit must be descriptive of the change
- The description should define what changes were made even if they are repeated from the issue
- A pull request should contain all the required changes to complete an issue
- Every Pull Request will be blocked until it is reviewed by someone else
- If you are the reviewer and are approving a change, you are responsible for merging the change and deleting the branch

### Creating an issue

- Under issue click "new issue"
- Add a descriptive title (ex. Doesn't Properly Load When Clicking X)

The person who requested the changes will specify what changes need to be made, if you have any follow up questions, reach out to the project manger! Make sure that you make the changes to the same branch and commit them. Github will automatically track that changes have been made and that it needs re-review. You should also mark the requested changes as resolved once you are done making them!
